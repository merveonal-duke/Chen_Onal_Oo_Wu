## Database Information

This analysis uses three databases: 
(<https://ytbsbilgi.teias.gov.tr/ytbsbilgi/frm_istatistikler.jsf>) for electricity consumption; (<https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Kategori/GetKategori?p=ulusal-hesaplar-113&dil=2>) for GDP growth rate; (<https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators>) for investment and population growth.

The Solowâ€“Swan model or exogenous growth model is an economic model of long-run economic growth. It attempts to explain long-run economic growth by looking at capital accumulation, labor or population growth, and productivity increases largely driven by technological progress. In our analysis, parallel with Solow-Swan model we assume that the production function takes the following form: Y = aKbL1-b  where 0 < b < 1. The production function is known as the Cobb-Douglas Production function, which is the most widely used neoclassical production function. We analyze the effect of investment growth which corresponds to capital accumulation and population growth on the GDP growth of Turkiye for the 1999-2022 period. We also analyze the impact of electricity consumption on the GDP growth. 
For details of each database, please refer to the files in the Metadata folder under the Data folder.
