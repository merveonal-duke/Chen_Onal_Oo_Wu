## Summary
This dataset is prepared for Project Assignment for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University, Spring 2024

The dataset contains electricity consumption data from TEIAS (Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation) in Turkiye from 1999 to 2022.

Generation and consumption data are generated by regular data collection from substations and power plant operators.
